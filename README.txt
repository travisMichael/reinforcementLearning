# Reinforcement Learning

This project explores the performance of several reinforcement learning algorithms for solving the frozen
lake and mountain car RL problems.

The project consists of multiple python programs that require python 3.6.8 or above. The project contains the following python dependencies (numpy, gym, and, matplotlib).

The project can be cloned by running the following command:

To generate the plots from the analysis paper, run the following command:

python main.py vi_mdp_one

python main.py pi_mdp_one

python main.py q_learner_one

python main.py vi_mdp_two

python main.py pi_mdp_two

python main.py q_learner_two
